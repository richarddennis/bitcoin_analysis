     - spit out average daily price history -> btcusd-avg-day-price.csv
     - spit out average weekly price history -> btcusd-avg-week-price.csv

 - _plotPriceChart.m_
   - Description: Matlab function that plots above data sets along with exponential fitted curves from three subsets of price data.
     - Note: must manually import .csv files into Matlab tables to feed into function
     - input arguments: price table, log scale y-axis (boolean)

## Bitcoin transaction and UTXO histories

 - _compress-btc-tx-history.py_
   - Description: compress previously exported transaction and utxo count historical data by calculating daily and weekly averages.
